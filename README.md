# Introduction
Are you tired of having to add 20 million different business scripts that all do the same but are just registered with a different job?  Well me TO!! introducing ren-businesses now you don't have to worry about adding a new business script you can just configure them in the config with just few clicks and few keyboard strokes. You're probably are asking but does ren-businesses have everything? Well maybe not everything but it is sure enough for your business man desires. ren-businesses comes included with duty, cash register, storage, outfit, ingredient store and crafting.

# Config
You can easily config every part of this business system, you can remove the unneeded things and the system won't break

# How to configure zones
 Target points are created with qb-target box zones so to add a new location you will need to use built in zone creating tools from PolyZone. You can find there wiki on how to use the tools [here](https://github.com/mkafrin/PolyZone/wiki/Using-the-creation-script)
